## What is this library for?

This library allows to control an [Isabelle](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/) process
from a Scala application. It allows to interact with the Isabelle process, 
manipulate objects such as terms and theorems as if they were local Scala objects,
and execute ML code in the Isabelle process. The library serves a similar purpose
as the discontinued [libisabelle](https://github.com/larsrh/libisabelle).

## Further reading
